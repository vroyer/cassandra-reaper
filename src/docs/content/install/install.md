## We provide prebuilt install binaries

The prebuilt install binaries for Reaper can be found on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/thelastpickle) and on the [Releases](https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra-reaper/releases) page of the GitHub Repository.

You can also find the installation binaries on the [downloads](../../downloads) page.

## Reaper can be run as a foreground application 

You can run Reaper in the foreground. This is useful when developing and testing the application.

The Reaper binaries are available in a `tar.gz` package. Once decompressed, you can run the application using the following command: 

```
java -jar target/cassandra-reaper-X.X.X.jar server resource/cassandra-reaper.yaml
```

This will start the Reaper application in the foreground using the configuration that stores the repair information in an [in-memory](../../backends/memory) database. 

Once started, the web UI can be accessed using the following URL. See the [Using Reaper](../../usage) section for more information on using the Reaper UI.

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/webui/
```

{{% notice note %}}
Reaper can also be accessed using the [REST API](../../development/api) exposed on port 8080, or using the command line tool `bin/spreaper`
{{% /notice %}}

The _resource/_ directory has a configuration for each of the respective [backend](../../backends) storage options. You can further configure the Reaper application by modifying settings in the _resource/cassandra-reaper.yaml_ [configuration](../../configuration) file.
