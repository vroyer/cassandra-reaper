We provide a number of methods to install and run Reaper.

If you want to install from a tarball or OS install package, see the [Package Install Guide](install). Information about upgrading a package install can be found in the [Upgrade Guide](upgrade).

If you want to run Reaper in a container, see the [Docker Guide](docker).

For information about building the binaries from source, including the Docker image, head over to the [Build from Source](../../development/building) guide in the [Development Resources](../../development) section.
